sqlite3 is a built-in library, we just need to import it...
The steps of handling sqlite3 databases are : 
1. Connect to a DB
2. Create a cursor object
3. Write an SQL query
4. Commit Changes
5. Close database connection

Notes - the cursor is used mostly for executing commands, and for connecting to the outside world, eg. opening closing databases, we use the connection

After a SELECT command is executed... we can use the cursor object to 'fetchAll()'... it returns a list, having elements as tuples, where each tuple is a row
