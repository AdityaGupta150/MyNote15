[27 Jan 2020]	1. Decimal value of 37 is 55
				Explained :  Hex to Dec - (37)^16 = ( 3*16^1 + 7*16^0)^10 = (48 + 7)^10 = (55)^10
				(255)^10 = (ff)^16
				2. background : linear-gradient(direction, color1, color2,... color_n, transparency(b/w 0 and 1))
				3. In case the body tag, only contains a div block, then the css styles for the body tag wont have any effect, there must be something else than the div block inside the body... even a <br> would work
				4. HTTP Codes- 
				200 -OK
				304 - Not Modified (using cached copy)
				404 - Not Found
				504 - GateWay Timeout (timeout from server's side)

				5. <div> vs <section> vs <nav> -> div(divide) iss totally non-semantic, it doesn't tell anything on its own. While section is quite explicit in the way that it tells and separates contents into section. And nav is a new HTML5 element, and is a 'specialization' of a div element, used specifically for navigation bar... div can do almost all, but if possible use the ones that do that work, since it makes code more easier to read, and debug
				
				6. Symbols for HTML entities -> '&lt' AND '&#60' is for '<' (less than)
				#9658 is the element_code for play button

				7. <div> and <span> element are two 'meaningless' elements... The main difference b/w them is that <div> separates the block vertically from content prev and after, while span does so horizontally

				8. We can 'kind of' imitate rows of a table using <div> blocks... ie. a div block for wrapping all rows(ie. it will be the table), and a div for each row(ie. replacing tr)

				9. <strong></> mostly bolds the text, but what it actually tells is that it's the important element, for eg. voice synthesis will read out that part with more emphasis, since blind people won't be able to see the bold text either

				10. HTML removes all of the extra spaces after any element whether it's a space or tab, nor even a newline... for eg. <p>Hi Aditya</p> and <p>Hi Aditya           </p> will be treated equally

				# <a> meant 'anchor tag'
				  It's target attribute -> it is by default target='_self'
				  And, to open in another tab, set target='_blank'

				11. Elements inside <table> ->
					<tr> - Row
					<th> - Heading
					<td> - Column

				12. CSS takes whatever last defined style for an element is present

				13.	CSS Selector Cominations
				For eg. .class1.class2{/*Only apply for elements having both classes*/} 
				h1.class1{
					//Applies to all <h1> tags that have class as 'class1'
				}
				For eg.
					.ancestor .child{
						property: value;
					}
					div p{
					/*Applies only to <p> tags 'just' inside a <div> block*/
					}

					Difference - Space between both

					It will be applied iff class='child' is inside some tag with class='ancestor'
				For eg.
					.brother1, .brother2{
						/*Applies to any element with 'either' of them*/
					}

				14. Element selectors are the lowest level selector, and are maostly overridden by class selectors, which themselves can only be overridden by id selectors... since an element can have multiple classes, but can have only one id... and that too should be unique, but html actually doesn't enforce this.
				More Advance Eg.
					#id.class.class2 {/*Will override the below block's properties, even though it appears earlier*/}

					.class.class2.class3{
						color: /*Gives color to text*/
						height: /*Height of div block*/
						width: /*Width of div block, percentage is relative to the width of the parent; '1em'='16px' and is mostly used in cases of fonts, and is relative to the current font (2em means 2 times the 'current font' (ie. either the body, all, or its parent) size); rem is similar to em in sense that it scales off the font size, but is different since it scales off relative to the font-size of the root element (ie. relative to the default and is independent to its parent, ie. 16px)*/
						padding: /*Space from its own border*/
						margin: /*Space from surrounding objects*/
					}
